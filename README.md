# Racket-Scheme

Programming Assignment 3.

1. Write a scheme function named up-to-first-number that takes a list as its input and returns a list containing all the elements up to the first numeric element in the input list.  You can use the number? predicate function to determine whether an element is a number or not. 

Sample runs:
(up-to-first-number '(a b c d 1 2 3 ))  returns (a b c d)
(up-to-first-number '(d e f 7)) returns (d e f)
(up-to-first-number '(g h i)) returns (g h i)
(up-to-first-number '(1 2 3)) returns NIL

2. Write a scheme function find-loc which takes two parameters, a list lst and an atom atm, and returns the index of the first location where atm occurs in the list. 
The location index is 1-relative. If atm does not occur in the list, the function returns n + 1, where n is the length of the list. 
(Find-loc â€˜(a b c d e f) e) 5

3. Write a function named longer-list that takes two list arguments and returns the longer list of the two inputs. If the two lists are equal in length, the function returns #t, and if one of the arguments is not a list, the function should return #f. 
Note: You are not allowed to use the predefined length function; however, you can write your version of length or other helper functions that you may want to call from longer-list.

Sample runs:
(longer-list '(1 2 3 4) '(a b c d e)) returns (a b c d e)
(longer-list '(d e f) '(4 5 6)) returns #t (or true)
(longer-list '(g h i) 3) returns #f (or false)
